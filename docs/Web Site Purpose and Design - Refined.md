# Website Purpose and Design Document

## 1. Website Objectives (Prioritized)

### Primary Objectives (v1)

1. **App Download/Install** - Clear, frictionless path to get users to download the mobile app
2. **Value Proposition Communication** - Instantly convey what Bondfires is and why it matters (asynchronous video-based men's community)
3. **Trust Building** - Establish credibility through privacy, security, and authentic messaging
4. **Host important documents** - We need a place to be able to link to and provide access to important documents such as privacy policy, terms of service, and community guidelines.

### Secondary Objectives (v2)

4. **Beginner Class Enrollment** - Entry point for beginners class (if this exists separate from the app)
5. **Educational/Awareness** - Raise awareness about male-centric issues the platform addresses
6. **Information Hub** - Provide comprehensive information about the app and men's group concept

### Tertiary Objectives (Future)

7. **Donations** - Not v1, but plan for future implementation
8. **Content Marketing** - Blog/podcast/news for SEO and community building

### Questions to Answer:

- What is the **single most important action** you want visitors to take? (Probably: download the app)
- What percentage of visitors do you expect to convert to app downloads? (This informs your design choices)
- Is the "beginners class" part of the app or a separate offering? How do they connect?

3. **How It Works:**

   - "What Makes Bondfires Different"
   - Async format, privacy, intentional structure

   - Testimonials (if available)

### Content Principles

### Questions to Answer:

- What's your brand voice? (Professional? Casual? Inspirational?)
- How do you explain "asynchronous video" to someone who's never heard of it?
- What visual style? (Screenshots? Illustrations? Video? Photography?)
- How much text is too much? (Homepage should be scannable in < 30 seconds)

---

## 8. Call-to-Action (CTA) Strategy

### Primary CTAs

- **"Download App"** - Above fold, prominent, repeated below fold
- **"Get Started"** - Alternative language for same action

### Secondary CTAs

- **"Learn More"** - For visitors who need more info
- **"Join Waitlist"** - If app isn't fully launched
- **"Watch Demo"** - Video walkthrough

### CTA Placement

- Hero section (primary)
- End of "How It Works" section
- End of homepage (sticky footer?)
- Dedicated "Download App" page
- In navigation (as button, not link)

### Questions to Answer:

- Should "Download App" be in the main navigation? (Probably yes)
- Do you have app store badges ready? (Apple App Store, Google Play)
- Should CTAs be different colors? (Match brand, but ensure contrast)
- How do you handle iOS vs. Android? (Auto-detect? Show both? QR codes?)

---

## 9. Branding & Visual Identity

### Visual Theme

- **Fire-lit Gathering Theme:**
  - Flame animations (subtle, not distracting)
  - Wood grain textures (backgrounds, accents)
  - Natural environments (forest, beach, desert, winter) - photos or illustrations?
  - Dark, earthy, fire tones (as mentioned)
  - Minimalist overall (don't overdo the fire theme)

### Color Palette

- **Primary:** Dark, earthy tones (gunmetal, charcoal)
- **Accent:** Fire tones (copper, amber, warm oranges)
- **Neutral:** Ash, grays for text
- **Reference:** Bondfire Brand Kit (Notion link in original doc)

### Typography

- **Headings:** Bold, readable (sans-serif for modern feel?)
- **Body:** Highly legible, accessible (consider dyslexia-friendly fonts)
- **Hierarchy:** Clear size differences

### Imagery Style

- **Photography vs. Illustration:** Need to decide
- **Tone:** Authentic, warm, inviting (not corporate or cold)
- **Diversity:** Represent diverse male community (age, race, background)

### Tagline Options (Refined)

**Top Picks (from your list):**

- "Reclaim the Power of Conversation" ⭐ (Strong, aspirational)
- "Gather around the digital fire" ⭐ (On-brand, warm, memorable)
- "Fuel your connections, fire up your potential" ⭐ (Action-oriented, uses fire metaphor)

**For Consideration:**

- "Connect on your own time" (Clear benefit, addresses pain point)
- "Thoughtful conversations, whenever you're ready" (Emphasizes async format)
- "No calendar tetris. Real connection." (Addresses pain point directly)

### Questions to Answer:

- Do you have finalized logos? (David built several - which one?)
- What's the final tagline decision? (Test multiple?)
- Should imagery be photos of real people or illustrations? (Photos = authentic, Illustrations = scalable)
- How do you represent "asynchronous" visually? (Time-shifted bubbles? Calendar crossing out? Video thumbnails with timestamps?)

- **Framework Options:**
  - Next.js (React, SSR, great SEO)
  - Remix (React, modern, fast)
  - Astro (Static site, great performance)
  - Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (simplest, but more manual work)

### Performance Requirements

- **Page Load:** < 2 seconds (critical for mobile)
- **Lighthouse Score:** 90+ (SEO and user experience)
- **Mobile-First:** Responsive design, touch-friendly
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA minimum

### SEO Considerations

- **Meta Tags:** Title, description, OG tags for social sharing

- **Content:** Blog/content strategy for organic traffic

### Analytics & Tracking

- **Primary:** Google Analytics 4 (or Plausible for privacy-focused alternative)
- **Conversion Tracking:** Tag downloads with UTM parameters

### Integration Points

### Questions to Answer:

### Responsive Breakpoints

- **Mobile:** 320px - 768px (primary focus)
- **Tablet:** 768px - 1024px
- **Desktop:** 1024px+ (secondary, but still important)

### Questions to Answer:

- Should mobile nav be bottom or hamburger? (Bottom = thumb-friendly, Hamburger = familiar)
- How do you handle app store detection? (Auto-show iOS or Android based on device)
- Do you show QR codes on desktop? (For easy phone scanning)

- **Urgency/Scarcity:** "Join X other men" or "Limited beta access"? (Use carefully, authentically)

### Questions to Answer:

- What's your current conversion rate? (Baseline before optimization)
