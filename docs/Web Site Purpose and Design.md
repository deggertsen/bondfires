## Website Objective

Working out the main purpose of the website. Here are some potential purposes:
-an entry point into the app

-an entry point into the mens group (basically same as app download)

-an entry point into a beginners class (secondary purpose of website)

-raising awareness of male-centric issues that the group/app are meant to solve (similar to secondary purpose)

-facilitate donations (not v1)

-provide information about the app and mens group

-inspire visitors to lead more connected, productive, peaceful, powerful, purposeful lives. (like this for marketing banner in its ability to show what we think the primary benefit.)

-side note pa (pals), pe(peaceful), pi, po(powerful), pu(purposeful) lives, haha. Not sure about the pi though. Maybe piloting, or pioneering, pivotal, pillar, or piquant(I looked up that last one).

## Target Audience

-men seeking support in areas like crises, victories, fatherhood, leadership, and just life.

-men seeking community

-aged 18 and up. Maybe a focus for men aged 25 to 75 (starts out when brains are more matured, caps out if a tech barrier).

-because both founders are in tech, and this is a tech solution to community, probably more tech savvy folks. Tech professions.

-US based mostly, but not necessarily

## Branding

“Be seen on your time”
”Be spleen on your time” - Liz

“Hear and be Heard” - blelch

“Fuel your connections” \*David

“Reclaim the Power of Conversation” - \* best I think

“You don’t have to go it alone”

“You don’t have to fight alone”

“Stop feeling afraid”

“Fuel your connections, fire up your potential” \*Best to David

“Lead a more connected, productive, peaceful, powerful, purposeful life” \*Also great

## Competitor Sites Review for Improvement/Differentiation

- The “on your own time” mens group.
- Stop playing calendar tetris.
- Don’t have a week to do a retreat? Then you’re in the right place.

### Key Observations for Bondfires Differentiation

- **Format Gap**: Nearly all emphasize synchronous (live) or in-person experiences. Bondfires' asynchronous video model—allowing thoughtful, time-shifted exchanges without scheduling conflicts—stands as a clear differentiator for men with demanding family or professional lives.
- **Privacy & Ethics**: Few highlight end-to-end encryption or explicit non-profit rejection of data harvesting to the degree we plan. This aligns strongly with our values of Trust, Ownership, and Integrity.
- **Structure**: Most lack customizable "camp" rules (e.g., response limits, threading depth, mandatory listening). Our intentional constraints and guided prompts could better ensure depth and uplift.
- **Accessibility**: Many require paid retreats or memberships; our free core platform with transparent premiums supports broader reach.
